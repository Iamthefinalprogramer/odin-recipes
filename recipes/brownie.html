    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this recipe, you will be crafting a nice and simple brownie. This brownie is a<br>
        chocolate walnut one. It is very fluffy and delectible. It is also very, very <br>
        easy to make. Give it a try!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
        <li>Butter: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the <br>
            brownies rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Walnuts: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>
