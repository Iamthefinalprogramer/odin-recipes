    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fried chicken is buttermilk based. It is very crispy and <br>
        juicy. It is perfect for any occasion! It has the perfect amount <br>
        of spice and is very well seasoned. Not to mention it is <br>
        insanely cripsy. What are you wating for? Give it a try!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of <br>
            chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you <br>
            use). Season flour with paprika (which helps to brown the <br>
            chicken), salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, <br>
            transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and <br>
            shake to coat well.</li>
        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and <br>
            cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT <br>
            UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE <br> 
            CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full 
            <br>with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown <br>
            the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>
        <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 <br>
            minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). <br>
            Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until <br>
            crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how <br>
            much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. <br>
            Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while <br>
            preparing the rest.</li>
    </ol>
