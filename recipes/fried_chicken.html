    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of <br>
            chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you <br>
            use). Season flour with paprika (which helps to brown the <br>
            chicken), salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, <br>
            transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and <br>
            shake to coat well.</li>
    </ol>
